1. The program adds three user-entered numbers and first determines the nature of the sum as even or odd. 
   It then checks the sum to decide whether it is a prime number, a composite number, or neither.

2. The program accepts a total number of seconds from the user and converts it into hours, minutes, and seconds. 
   It calculates each time component step by step and displays the result in hours–minutes–seconds format.

3. The program reads the number of electricity units consumed and calculates the total bill amount based on predefined rate slabs. 
   It applies different charges for each range of units and displays the final cost.

4. The program stores a user-defined password and allows the user up to three attempts to re-enter it correctly. 
   If the password matches within three tries, access is granted; otherwise, the program exits after three failed attempts.

5. The program reads an array of integers and removes duplicate elements by comparing each element with the rest of the array. 
   When a duplicate is found, the elements are shifted to maintain continuity and the final array without duplicates is displayed.

6. The program reads a string, counts the number of vowels and consonants by examining only alphabetic characters, and displays the count. 
   It then scrambles the string by implementing the random number generator using srand(time(NULL)) and randomly swapping characters using 
   rand() to produce a shuffled output.

7. The program reads an array of integers and uses a pointer to traverse the array while tracking the largest and second largest values. 
   It updates these values by comparing each element and ensures duplicate values do not affect the result before displaying the second 
   largest element.

8. The program reads an array of integers and uses a pointer to access and swap adjacent elements in the array. It traverses the array 
   in steps of two, exchanges each pair of elements, and displays the modified array.

9. The program accepts a 4×4 matrix from the user and calculates the sum of all its elements. It then separately computes the sums 
   of the principal diagonal and the secondary diagonal and displays the results.

10.The program accepts a matrix from the user and displays it in its original form. It then rotates the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise 
   by rearranging elements into a new matrix and prints the rotated result.

11.The program accepts a set of integers and sorts them using either bubble sort or selection sort based on the user’s choice. After 
   sorting, it performs a binary search on the sorted array to locate a given element and displays the result.

12.The program uses a structure to store product details such as ID, quantity, name, and price, while ensuring that each product ID is 
   unique. It calculates the total cost of all products and identifies the products with the maximum quantity and maximum price, 
   displaying their details.

13.The program accepts the number of rows and prints a triangle pattern using nested loops. One loop handles spacing while
   the other prints stars to form the triangular shape.

14.The program opens a text file and reads it character by character to count characters, words, and lines. 
   It identifies words by detecting transitions from separators to non-separator characters and displays the final counts.

15.The program calculates the nth term of the Fibonacci series using a recursive function. It generates each term by passing 
   the previous two values as parameters until the required term is reached.

16.The program uses a recursive function to process a string and compress it by counting repeated characters. It skips separators 
   and previously processed characters, then prints each character along with its frequency if it occurs more than once.
